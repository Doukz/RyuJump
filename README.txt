My game, RyuJump, was primarily inspired by a concept I developed in Game Art about a sea god. The environment displayed is the only one where Ryu can face genuine danger so I felt it fitting for my test game. I want to one day make this concept into an indie game, and I like reusing my ideas for projects cause I get to see my little guys in action :D

In RyuJump you can run left and right as well as jump. Due to collision on every surface you can also wall jump (and ceiling jump...) 

RyuJump is singleplayer, created in Unity 2D, and takes place over the course of 14 seconds (intro and outro included). There's Audio for the intro, main, and two game over states, as well as an indicator of what to do to win at the beginning as well as an arrow pointing where to go. 

I included audio for every requirement except the jump/sound effect required during the main game state. I made the audio in a browser itchio program. I may not be a musician.

RyuJump meets all of the visual requirements (drawn by me, background, sprite as well as UI) except for the particle effect. 

It's a basic platformer but I hope you enjoyed :) feel free to use this as an example, though I doubt it would be since it's missing stuff.
